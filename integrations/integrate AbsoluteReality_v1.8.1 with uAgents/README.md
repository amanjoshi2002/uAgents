# Business Model
AI Storytelling Agent

## Welcome
Welcome to the AI Storytelling Agent project! This project utilizes cutting-edge AI models to generate stories from text,by converting story paragraphs into images, and compile them into a PDF document.

## Features
- **Story Generation**: Input a text prompt, and the AI agent will generate a story based on it.
- **Image Creation**: Each part of the story is converted into an image.
- **PDF Compilation**: All generated images with associated prompts are compiled into a PDF document.

## Setup
1. **Clone Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pixathon-Saavyas/Coderz
    ```
3. **Generate Story**:
    Give an Input to DeltaV Chat Interface
    The model will automatically generate a story, break it   down into paragraphs and submit those paragraphs to the model to generate images.

    Sample Prompt 
Once upon a time, there once was a black horse named Midnight. Midnight lived on a sprawling ranch nestled in the heart of the countryside, where the grass swayed in the breeze and the scent of wildflowers perfumed the air.

4. **View PDF**:
    
    Once the story is generated, a PDF file (`all_images_with_text.pdf`) will be created in the project directory containing the compiled story images with associated prompts.
